### Day 1: February 9 2017

Today's Progress: Joined the challenge.Finishing up Basic Javascript on freeCodecamp. Did some testing on sourcetree while connected to github.

### Day 2: February 10 2017

Today's Progress: Completely finished the Basic Javascript section from freeCodecamp.

Thoughts: I'll be honest that I'm still very confused, took me 3 hours to finish the last part of the demos. I'm planning to supplement the demos with Lynda.com videos as well.

Deciding if I should stick with Github desktop or sourcetree

### Day 3: February 11 2017

Today's Progress: Completely finished Object Oriented and Functional Programming section at freecodecamp. Did first algorithim scripting demo.

Thoughts: Javascript is starting to clear a bit for me now, algorithim demos helping me put it all together. Added more notes to github notebook about where to keep focus.

### Day 4: February 14 2017

Today's Progress: Created simple HTML page with CSS to test a simple Javascript function.

Thoughts: Working from scratch like this works better for learning JS I feel, I'll continue to create demo's each day if I can to learn JS and keep my HTML/CSS skills up to date too.
