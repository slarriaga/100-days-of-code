100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 9 2017

Today's Progress: Joined the challenge.Finishing up Basic Javascript on freeCodecamp. Did some testing on sourcetree while connected to github.

Thoughts: Struggling with case/else/if scenarios, trying not to get myself frustrated, making sure to take breaks and let my head rest.

### Day 2: February 10 2017

Today's Progress: Completely finished the Basic Javascript section from freeCodecamp.

Thoughts: I'll be honest that I'm still very confused, took me 3 hours to finish the last part of the demos. I'm planning to supplement the demos with Lynda.com videos as well.

Deciding if I should stick with Github desktop or sourcetree
